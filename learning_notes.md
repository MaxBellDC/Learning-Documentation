# Class Work - July 10

The 2 learning links I have chosen are the CPU Visual Simulator and the Visual Transistor-level Simulation

## Learning Link 1

**Link title:** CPU Visual Simulator

**URL:** https://cpuvisualsimulator.github.io/

**Summary of content:** 
The CPU Visual Simulator offers an interactive platform to explore the inner workings of a CPU. It provides a detailed look at CPU architecture, how instructions are processed, and allows users to input their own instructions to see the step-by-step execution.

**Key takeaways:**
- Comprehensive understanding of CPU architecture and operations.
- Visualization of data flow and control signals within the CPU.
- Enhanced comprehension of how different instructions are executed by the CPU.
- The micro-step feature enables users to develop a futher understanding of each minute step the CPU takes during its operations.
- Interactive simulations help in visualizing the theoretical concepts learned in class.
- Ability to input custom instructions allows for experimentation and deeper learning.

**Personal insights/reflection:**
This simulator provided a unique and engaging way to learn about CPU operations. The visual representation helped demystify complex processes, making it easier to understand how instructions are executed and how different CPU components interact.

## Learning Link 2

**Link title:** Visual Transistor-level Simulation

**URL:** http://www.visual6502.org/

**Summary of content:** 
The Visual 6502 project provides a detailed simulation of the MOS 6502 microprocessor, widely used in early computers and gaming systems. It offers a transistor-level view of the microprocessor and allows users to see real-time instruction execution.

**Key takeaways:**
- In-depth look at the MOS 6502 microprocessor's operations.
- Understanding microprocessor functionality at the transistor level.
- Real-time visualization of instruction execution and component interaction.
- Detailed simulation of the microprocessorâ€™s internal workings, down to individual transistors.
- Historical significance of the MOS 6502 in early computing and gaming consoles.
- Enhanced appreciation for the complexity and design of microprocessors.

**Personal insights/reflection:**
This resource was incredibly enlightening, offering a deep dive into the MOS 6502 microprocessor. Seeing the processor operate at a transistor level gave me a greater appreciation for its design and functionality. I would definitely enjoy developing a further understanding of every part of the CPU that is being represented in this simulation.
